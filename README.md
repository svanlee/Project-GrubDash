<div class="sc-havuDZ dPxsLw"><h2>Project description: GrubDash</h2><p>You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash! As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas for the big bosses.</p><p>For detailed instructions on how to complete this project, consult the <span class="sc-bKoJNE hTFgFD">Instructions </span>document in the Qualified assessment interface.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/web-dev-programs/blob/master/library/zid-be-project-grub-dash-01-qualified/content.md#learning-objectives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"></a>Learning objectives</h2><p>This project will test your ability to build APIs with complex validation. Before taking on this project, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below:</p><ul><li><p>Running tests from the command line</p></li><li><p>Using common middleware packages</p></li><li><p>Receiving requests through routes</p></li><li><p>Accessing relevant information through route parameters</p></li><li><p>Building an API following RESTful design principles</p></li><li><p>Writing custom middleware functions</p></li></ul><p>You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/web-dev-programs/blob/master/library/zid-be-project-grub-dash-01-qualified/content.md#grubdash-frontend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"></a>GrubDash frontend</h2><p>Although it isn't required, if you would like to see this project connected to a frontend application, visit the following repository:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-grub-dash-front-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Starter code: GrubDash frontend</a></p></li></ul><p>Instructions on how to get the frontend application up and running are included in the repository.<a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/cba6ab5c14e78c57014a67f725f76df1a4fd1d32385b810b21336b7b1a0272f2/68747470733a2f2f7265732e636c6f7564696e6172792e636f6d2f7374726976652f696d6167652f75706c6f61642f775f313030302c685f313030302c635f6c696d69742f31666337663931366532313436653635396637393334613733623130336532352d686f6d652e706e67" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"></a></p><img alt="GrubDash frontend." height="1000" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/c7lxnbtvvcxm/4LmGQIVbchP9nSxprM6GRf/d0df0421c3eac33ad985d77cca94ebe2/GrubDash.png" width="966" class="sc-gJjCVn jSYvfE" srl_elementid="0"><p>Again, it isn't necessary to connect the frontend to complete this project successfully.</p><p>Remember to sync this Qualified project with your local machine so that you can commit it to GitHub in the next lesson.
